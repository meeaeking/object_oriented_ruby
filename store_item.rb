# A. Use the terminal to create a new folder in your actualize folder called object_oriented_ruby.
# B. Create a new file in the folder called store_item.rb and open it in Sublime.
# C. Use hashes with symbols to represent the following scenario:
# C.1 - You are the owner of a store that sells items (you decide what specifically). Each item has various properties such as color, price, etc.
# C.2 - Represent 3 items using hashes. Each hash should have the same keys with different values.
# C.3 - Be sure to use symbols for the keys. Try creating hashes using both types of hash symbol syntaxes. (Ruby syntax {:a => 123} vs. “JavaScript” syntax {a: 123}).
# Bonus: Read more about Ruby’s hash symbol syntax:


# shirt = {
#   color: "blue",
#   price: 35,
#   inventory: 28
# }

# pants = {
#   color: "yellow",
#   price: 50,
#   inventory: 30
# }

# dress = {
#   color: "red",
#   price: 80,
#   inventory: 23
# }

# p shirt[:color]

# shirt = {
#   :color => "blue",
#   :price => 35,
#   :inventory => 28
# }

# pants = {
#   :color => "yellow",
#   :price => 50,
#   :inventory => 30

# dress = {
#   :color => "red",

# Rewrite your store items using a class instead of a hash.
# a) Choose which attributes should have “reader” methods and which attributes should have “writer” methods.
# b) Create an instance from your store item class. Use puts statements to print the 3 attributes individually to the terminal.

# Replace your “reader” and “writer” methods using the attr_reader and attr_writer shortcuts!

# Rewrite your store items using a class with a single options hash in the initialize method.
